Compare prescription drug prices and find coupons to save up to 80%, even with insurance.\n\nMost Americans don't know that prescription prices vary wildly from pharmacy to pharmacy. There's never been a way to compare drug prices - until now. \n\nGoodRx makes comparing prescription drug prices easy. Our app provides current cash and sale prices, manufacturer coupons, pharmacy discounts and valuable savings tips for thousands of prescriptions at pharmacies near you. GoodRx tells you which pharmacies have many popular generic drugs for less than $4 per fill, and some where certain prescriptions for free! \n\nBest of all, many of our savings coupons can be used from within the app - simply hand your phone to the pharmacist to save up to 80%! No need to print out anything - find savings on the go!\n\nGoodRx is 100% free to use - there are no fees or obligations to you. You can use GoodRx for every member of your family, including pets. To protect your privacy, you can also create a passcode to limit access to the app.\n\nGoodRx has been featured by Consumer Reports, The New York Times, PBS, ABC News, Forbes, CNN, The LA Times and more. Our app is used by hundreds of doctors and clinics to help save patients money on their medications.\n\nGoodRx loves our reviews and may sometimes use them, in whole or edited form, in our marketing materials. Read our Terms of Use for more info.\n\nHere's what GoodRx users are saying: \n\n\"I am still in shock!!! I called my doctor to cancel the prescription he ordered for me due to the cost. Then I found GoodRx. I brought your coupon to Walgreens and wound up paying $40.20 instead of the $452.97 that was their original cost. You guys are literally a lifesaver! The pharmacist was as surprised as I was. Thank you so much!\" \n\n“As a doctor, I’m always interested in saving money for my patients. GoodRx helps my patients afford the drugs they need - and it’s so easy!”\n\n\"I decided to give your site a spin and was pleasantly surprised to see you guys saved my $50 a month right off the bat.

It’s just not worth it, Roger.\n\nNow that we’re back to school, we’re loading up the discounts for vaccinations, Epipens, coughs, colds and flu. Winter is decidedly less fun, but if that means less athlete’s foot (and less TikToks), we’re all for it.\n\nOther than that, not much to report from HQ, but thanks for asking. We got a nifty new espresso maker, resulting in a 37% increase in productivity, but then Bachelor In Paradise started up again and, well….as I said, not much to report.  We told our boss we fixed a few bugs and he said “Oh, cool. Nice work.” We’re 98% sure he still uses a Palm Pilot.\n\nObvious reminder - you can still save lots with GoodRx on all your meds.
