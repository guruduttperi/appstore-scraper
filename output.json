With our neat little tool, you can take or import a photo of your pregnancy test stick and apply photo effects to make that (hopefully visible) second line easier to see. Current effects include grayscale, invert, brighten, contrast, saturation and hue and we are working on adding more features!\n\nWe have also launched a community where you can share photos of your tests that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible.

An app for horse riding that automatically tracks the horse’s movements and gives it back as valuable information to the rider. A new way to improve horse management. Add your stable, horses and connect with your co-riders. Come closer to your equestrian team and connect with your horse friends, coach, farrier, veterinarian and trainer. Plan and organize your equestrian life in a horse customized calendar and give your team and your dearest peace of mind by sharing your position live while riding. More than 250 000 riders use Equilab, in all disciplines; show jumping, dressage, eventing, Icelandic horses, western, horse racing, endurance riding, polo, academic art of riding.\n\nWhy Equilab? \n- You can focus on your feeling in the saddle while Equilab captures every hoof step \n- Analyze your training pattern over time and understand your progress\n- Come closer to your team and share your trainings with them \n- Collect everything about your equestrian life in the same place  \n- Plan and organize future events for you and your horse \n- Stay safe when you are out hacking or ride alone in the arena by sharing your position \n- Works for Icelandic horses\n- Can integrate with HealthKit to export your trainings into the Apple Health app and read information improving the analysis\n- Works with Apple Watch\n\nEquilab automatically measures your trainings with the help of your phone’s sensors and shows:\n- Gait distribution during your trainings\n- Percentage distribution between right and left turns during the exercise\n- Beat, stride and speed \n- Time and distance\n- Map of your riding tracks\n- Energy consumption for the rider and horse \n- Compilation of your training history\n- Horse diary of your trainings\n\nPlace your phone in a tight fit pocket close to your body or in a sports armband. \n\nSafety Tracking \nDo you feel nervous when you or someone you love are out hacking or ride when no one is at the stable? We listened to that, and therefore, we created Safety Tracking. Riders all around the world have told us that they feel uncomfortable while they are riding if no one knows where they are. They have tried to solve that by texting someone when they start to ride and when they are back. But still, who knows if something happens in between and if something happens, where the rider is? Safety Tracking solves that. Let someone follow your ride live from their phone until you are back safe. Equilab shares your position and important information about your ride from the saddle, so if something happens to you, they who follow you will see exactly where you are on the map.\n\nSubscriptions\nEquilab offer one subscription with three different periods, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months. The subscriptions include full access to calendar, safety tracking and some new upcoming features!\n\nTerms of service\nYou can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

The app provides a gradual, self-guided training program designed to help you understand and adopt a simple mindfulness practice. Mindfulness Coach also offers a library of information about mindfulness (for example “What is Mindfulness?”, “How to Anchor Your Attention”), 12 audio-guided mindfulness exercises and a growing catalog of additional exercises available for free download, goal-setting and tracking, a mindfulness mastery assessment to help you track your progress over time, customizable reminders, and access to other support and crisis resources.

We make it easy to fit meditation into your daily routine to get its benefits such as reduced stress/anxiety, better sleep, mange pain and increase performance. \n\nYou have full control over reminders and daily routines that break your daily practice into small but highly effective and digestible mindful pauses, lessons and practices.\n\nDaily lessons help to refine and tune your personal path to peace. The Healthkit integrated timer supports building your mindful minutes practice. And the “Lifelog” captures your own journal to discover insights.\n\n“This app is like my best friend. I feel like it asks me how I’m doing? How am I feeling? What mood am I in?...The alerts, the reminders, the pauses [let] you be still for a moment. Very highly recommend this app!” \n- Joeykcmo (iTunes review)\n\n\"I am bipolar and anxiety is a constant struggle for me. I started mindfulness a few months ago after my new therapist recommended it & found the breathing exercises helpful but really easy to forget or ignore. \n\nThis app has reminders, guides you through the meditation techniques & the best part is the pause button. When I start feeling tense I just take a little pause and get my breathing under control. Having the images to view while breathing activates more of my mind freeing the anxious thoughts. The reminders can be set for whenever or how often I may need them which helps me return to the moment when I don't even realize I'm tense. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety or just wants to live a more mindful, present life.\"\n- PookusJ (iTunes review)\n\nFeatured:\n\n- Featured in the iTunes App Store “What’s Hot” list in over 20 countries\n- Developed with leading scientists, doctors, researchers, coaches and trainers\n- Recommended by the Daily Mail as a “Stress-Busting Smartphone App to Keep You Calm on the Go”\n- Powered by inward inc., which has been mentioned in The NYTimes, Newsweek, and NPR\n\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Integration with Apple's Health app to track Mindful Minutes\n- Simple Start program: 21 days of free mindfulness audio lessons.

It also happens to be the best designed app in this category I've seen.” -ForgetPerfect (iTunes review)\n\n“While I know there are no ‘quick fixes’ when it comes to kids, this app is as close to one as I've found. I began the lessons to help deal with stress at work, and my 5th grader wanted to know what the audio reminders were about. I explained and know he's doing the lessons with me. They are working wonders on our frustration tolerance during homework and work! As soon as we start to feel that tension build, we remind each other of what we've been learning and practicing, take a moment, and regroup.” -John-546 (iTunes review)","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/42/da/47/42da47a5-5e0b-142f-4184-8dca78e72eb2/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"116435968","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2013-12-18T22:17:20Z","updated":"2018-09-12T04:44:03Z","releaseNotes":"Major update: New “Today” screen, “Now” cards and reminders fit Mindfulness easily into your daily routine.\n\nTry adding new reminders or activities to your Morning, Day or Night routine that link to your favorite programs, tracks or pauses.\n\nThroughout the day you’ll see the most relevant “Now Cards” from your Today screen read to complete.
