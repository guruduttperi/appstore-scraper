The app is designed to quickly and simply help you do more brisk walking in bursts of ten minutes, known as Active 10s. It tracks all your walking and rewards your progress.\n\nKey features:\n•\tBreaks your target down into manageable chunks of ten minutes of brisk walking\n•\tShows you when you’ve walked at the right speed\n•\tGives you goals to work towards\n•\tRewards your progress \n•\tShows where you can convert normal walking into Active 10s \n•\tProvides hints and tips \n\nBRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH\n\nWe all know how important it is to be active. The good news is that you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!\n\nJust ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping  and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head.\n\nActive 10s are simple to fit into your day, from taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can impact battery life.\n\nThis app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.\n\nThis is an early version of the app. If you have any feedback for how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk. \n\nFrequently asked questions: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10/faqs#xQYHQxaKMtCArDuc.97","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/de/f0/9c/def09cae-ae1d-e29e-d63a-f53944179e5c/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6013"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"29758464","requiredOsVersion":"9.0","released":"2017-03-14T17:25:47Z","updated":"2019-09-16T08:51:35Z","releaseNotes":"Bug fix and improvements","version":"2.8.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":1015850255,"developer":"Public Health England","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/public-health-england/id1015850255?uo=4","developerWebsite":"http://www.nhs.uk/oneyou","score":3.5,"reviews":43,"screenshots":["https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/d2/53/d4/d253d49c-cfde-8f95-65a1-10011df24b93/mzl.otqibmde.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/54/5d/a0/545da058-d567-586d-229c-c51034c55714/mzl.nevimiqj.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/e6/3d/75/e63d75b0-e042-d605-1d79-805dc2dfb479/mzl.wctcskhw.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/10/41/20/10412033-8a6f-1b22-751a-a8263a5ee9a2/mzl.njiyofzn.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"]},{"id":353415135,"appId":"com.kidsdr.kidsdrapp","title":"The Kid's Doctor","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-kids-doctor/id353415135?uo=4","description":"Every parent needs a partner they can trust.

The app allows you to participate in anonymity, if needed, and it is a safe for all ages.\n\nThe app helps you increase and extend loving intentional vibrations surrounding a personal, community or global event. In just a few clicks you can form groups, invite participants, and share your request for a joining of their heart’s energy to achieve the highest good for all concerned. \n\nToo often we want to 'do something' about a situation, but feel too busy, too remote, too alone, or too inconsequential. Now, through Pantagea, it takes only seconds to connect your heart with events on the app. There you can offer love and support to others through your form of prayer. There is no need for a shared language, culture, or religion — just the joining of hearts' intentions. \n\nThe app allows you to see your energy in action and the deep appreciation of those receiving your prayers. Watch as shared vibrations increase. \n\nThe app contains the following features:\n• Vibes - You may choose your vibration, create your group, set your intentions and schedule it\n• Reminders - allows you to form your group in advance and post it when the time is right\n• Manifestations -  a unique and easy way to focus on your vision and allow it into your life\n• Journal Page - a way to share experiences and learn about this unique field of unity and love\n\nStart sharing your time and energy and be part of raising the vibrations.\n\nBlessings,\nPantagea Family\n\n#Love #Energy #Vibrations #Prayer #Manifestation #Fun #Unity #Meditation #Emotions #Intention #Oneness #Mindfulness #Communication #HighestGood #Universe","icon":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/3a/c3/ab/3ac3ab62-8099-d05d-b1e8-62995cc22033/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Social Networking"],"genreIds":["6012","6005"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"65982464","requiredOsVersion":"10.0","released":"2018-09-04T20:32:41Z","updated":"2019-04-06T01:59:31Z","releaseNotes":"• Improvements and bug fixes.","version":"2.2.1","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":1435004841,"developer":"NuDreem, LLC","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nudreem-llc/id1435004841?uo=4","score":5,"reviews":14,"currentVersionScore":5,"currentVersionReviews":2,"screenshots":["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/d3/e7/6f/d3e76f38-faaf-0272-de06-84ecc33f7e6b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/d3/cb/7f/d3cb7f78-4f28-f8ca-c654-12d8d8b54eea/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/dc/e2/7d/dce27d2e-477d-9c23-9b6d-1c6e7a333c81/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/7f/09/8f/7f098f5c-3815-40f0-edd1-4f2f3cf08d68/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/d0/9a/ef/d09aefb7-118d-c9c7-acfe-1ac33fbe9a62/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/48/1b/b2/481bb295-e096-e3ad-c05d-96441d36d0b3/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/51/c3/4f/51c34f1e-45a2-e5d4-9bea-479a5a06ae85/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/ef/ab/a0/efaba05e-0253-4d21-5be3-0194cfd327d6/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/d3/45/2b/d3452bc4-1c73-83ec-4310-bccf697d71ec/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/c5/42/81/c54281e2-1458-eed1-665a-ea587449578b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5-iPhone5","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","Watch4-Watch4","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","Watch5-Watch5","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"]},{"id":1350048019,"appId":"com.eighty4Inc.SQRL","title":"SQRL","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sqrl/id1350048019?uo=4","description":"SQRL provides a simple way for you to train your emotional, physical, and financial well-being everyday.\n\nWe believe you already have everything you need to live your best life, but we could do with a nudge at the right time.

It uses wristbands and tags to track and report the location of people and objects within your facility.  Guard1 can be used at correctional facilities, hospital and medical facilities, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.\n \nThe Guard1 Tracking Mobile App is designed to be used in conjunction with Guard1 Tracking Server software to record well-being checks, inspections, and movement into, out of, and within your facility.\n \nAlerts – Guard1 Tracking generates alerts for out-of-bounds or keep-separate violations. It tracks who acknowledged the alert for complete traceability. You can put tags on tools and utensils – kitchen implements, for example – and receive an alert if they are taken out of their allowed areas.\n \nWhiteboard – Many facilities use some sort of a board in their housing units to keep track of bed assignments and in- and out-counts visually. They move the cards or write on the whiteboard to indicate that an individual is out of the housing unit, at an appointment, or recreation, or medical, or whatever. Guard1 Tracking uses a similar concept. The whiteboard view (shown above) is probably the one your staff will use the most in Guard1 Tracking, because it is similar to something you are probably doing now, and it presents a lot of information at once.\n \nMaps – The map view is a convenient way to get a look at who is where in your facility. Click on a zone to see a list of all the tags in the zone, including staff members and objects. The map view also provides a graphical display of where any active alerts are in your facility.\n \nIndividual Detail – Select an individual and view details, ID number, current location, keep-separates.\n \nPeople Search – Guard1 has advanced searching to quickly locate information about a specific individual. You can search by first or last name, ID number, gender, released/not released, and more.\n \nHandouts - Record distribution of meals, medication, personal items – anything!\n \nOut Zones - Document transfers outside your facility, for medical, court, work release, or other purposes.  Record the expected return time and get an alert if the individual has not returned when expected.\n \nActivities - Document escorts, services like showers, visitation, classes – anything!\n \nMonitors – See all activity for a group of people or a zone in real time.\n \nReports – Guard1 Tracking includes a powerful reporting engine. Easily set up reports to filter for a specific date and time period, specific individuals or zone, and so forth. Export your reports in a variety of formats including PDF, Word, or Excel.","icon":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/f9/3b/02/f93b0202-c52c-d3d4-5ad6-0b0312909e92/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Business"],"genreIds":["6000"],"primaryGenre":"Business","primaryGenreId":6000,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"38558720","requiredOsVersion":"10.0","released":"2017-08-17T14:55:15Z","updated":"2018-10-04T18:37:30Z","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes and stability improvements.","version":"6.34.3","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":928605585,"developer":"TimeKeeping Systems, Inc.","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/timekeeping-systems-inc/id928605585?uo=4","developerWebsite":"https://www.guard1.com/Software/Inmate-Tracking-System-Software.aspx","currentVersionScore":1,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/2b/1a/ef/2b1aefa1-e82d-9c22-c5ee-53aa934d3f34/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/89/a5/6f/89a56ff8-6c81-3d84-455b-3561b5863193/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/c7/00/0d/c7000d2a-34f2-5993-1c42-e299a5f2518b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/4d/b6/0d/4db60ddc-0b45-e3ed-b15c-bbe498796cea/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/5e/7c/22/5e7c228f-9173-11a7-53c7-7fc1763a1b1c/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5-iPhone5","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"]},{"id":1434784934,"appId":"com.itnnovation.health","title":"The Health & Wellbeing App","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-health-wellbeing-app/id1434784934?uo=4","description":"The Health and Wellbeing App is a unique social experience designed specifically for Health and Wellbeing Enthusiasts.

We’ve combined the convenience, practicality and accessibility found in today’s best smartphone and tablet app technologies, with the familiar comfort, personal connection, attention to detail and individual understanding that comes with family care. The result is the Wellbeing Monitor.\n\nResponsive Support for Independent Seniors\n\nMany seniors are happy to carry on with their independent lifestyles and require only a minimal amount of additional care support to sustain the benefits of aging in place. In many cases, they may not have the advantage of a nearby or fully available family member and this gap in their needs can become a source of anxiety for the entire family. Wellbeing Monitor meets this need with a remote wellbeing solution to ensure day-to-day wellbeing is maintained, and should urgent assistance ever be required, seniors are only one-click away from the response they need.\n\nWellbeing Monitor requires an active subscription for monitoring users. You may choose either a monthly or yearly subscription, and can choose different subscription levels for monitoring 1 user (29.99 monthly or 349.99 yearly), 2 users (59.99 monthly or 699.99 yearly), or 3 users (89.99 monthly or 999.99 yearly). Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and will be billed at a renewal cost of 1 user (29.99 monthly or 349.99 yearly), 2 users (59.99 monthly or 699.99 yearly), or 3 users (89.99 monthly or 999.99 yearly).

We eat while working or watching television, on the computer or phone, distracted with social media, or lost in our daily concerns and the endless to-do list. The impact is that the state of the body while eating is often contracted and even stressed; and it’s affecting our minds and our ability to digest optimally.\n\nMaking Peace Before You Eat is the companion app to Angie Cowen's much-anticipated second book, and has been designed to help you bring in connection, gratitude and the stillness of the present moment, wherever you may be.\n\nThe app offers audio meditations and rituals in a beautifully designed, easy-to-use format, and also includes a weekly meditation tracker and mindful map, showing a heat map of where in the world the mindful community is practicing with the app.\n\n------------------------------\n\nAbout the Team\n\nWe're committed to improving and expanding on this app, just as we always strive to improve and expand ourselves.

This can be quite shocking at first, but in our experience usually leads to making positive change in the right direction\n\n● SET TARGETS PUSHING YOUR LIFE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION*\nOnce you get a good idea of how you spend your time you can start to push areas of your life further. Spend 2 hours a week on health, then the next week aim for 3! \n\n● SEE WHAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WILL LOOK LIKE*\nLifepots uses what it knows about how you spend your time to predict how your life may look.

The Wellbeing App has been designed by nursery directors, managers and practitioners to quickly and effectively capture all aspects of a child’s care and daily routine including sleep and nappy change times, medication and food and drink consumption. No more lost paper copies before filing! A complete record of every aspect of a child’s care record in one place and accessed by date range, allowing easy tracking over periods of time. \n\nIt also provides a faster, more effective way to ensure you are sharing important information with parents. For busy parents who perhaps find it difficult to discuss their child’s full day at nursery during pick-up times, information from the app can be viewed in the INM Parent Portal and this allows them to reflect on their child’s day when they get home. Did their child have an afternoon nap? If so, for how long?

A regular wake and sleep time each day, achieved gradually over six weeks;\n2. An alarm clock that triggers fun activities designed to get you up and out of bed;\n3. Increasing your exposure to daylight early in the day, to help reset your body clock; and,\n4. Encouraging you to increase physical activity, especially within two hours of waking up. \n\nEstablishing a good sleep/wake routine that includes regular exercise and early daylight exposure will help improve your mood, energy and general health and wellbeing as well as helping you sleep better at night. \n\n---Features---\n• Receive practical tips to improve your sleep/wake routine and wellbeing\n• Get daily reports to track your mood, energy, exercise and sleep\n• View graphs to help monitor your progress\n\n---Progress tracker--- \nRecharge asks a few simple questions to set your personalised program goals. Simply answer a few questions about your mood, energy, exercise and sleep, to receive a daily report that will show you which goals you’ve met each day. Your progress tracker will help you see the relationship between your mood, energy, exercise and sleep over the six-week program.\n\n• Morning check in: Rate your sleep quality and note the time you went to bed\n• Afternoon check in: Rate your mood and energy (plus get a bonus tip)\n• Night check in: Log the amount and intensity of exercise you’ve done today\n\n---Wellbeing guide---\nSimply click on one of the helpful tips provided in the Recharge app to view the Wellbeing guide.

It’s natural to feel stressed before a performance or an exam, or even during a particularly busy or overstimulating period. However, anxiety itself is more than simply 'stress'. If you notice yourself experiencing anxiety for long periods of time, and you can't seem to kick it, a closer examination of this may be beneficial. \nAnxiety is a highly prevalent negative mental experience that can be experienced in a range from a chronic low dose of worry to sharp pangs of panic. When you're struggling with anxiety, it can seem impossible to overcome. Fortunately, there are mental and physical options for reducing anxiety and treating it at the source.\nThe following app may help reduce your anxiety levels, both in the heat of the moment and on a long-term basis.\nRecommend it to your Friends!!!","icon":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/55/14/e4/5514e4c8-bafe-7297-ea14-53f483b3211f/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Lifestyle"],"genreIds":["6013","6012"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN","PT","ES"],"size":"6045696","requiredOsVersion":"6.1","released":"2012-05-03T17:46:50Z","updated":"2014-05-28T17:55:37Z","releaseNotes":"Now in english and portuguese","version":"6.21","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":338711656,"developer":"TapCoder.com","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/tapcoder-com/id338711656?uo=4","screenshots":["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e4/7a/04/e47a0455-6cd2-e679-7b81-55db94261c0f/mzl.cpnbomwf.png/640x1136bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/f6/2b/f9/f62bf994-6549-626f-f4cc-13adaae648cc/mzl.ocrortns.png/640x1136bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/24/a9/1e/24a91e94-faa4-bbd8-6634-e4017fe0646a/mzl.yltpqyzy.png/360x480bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS","iPhone4-iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi","iPad23G-iPad23G","iPhone4S-iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5-iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini-iPadMini","iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G","iPhone5c-iPhone5c","iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","Watch4-Watch4","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","Watch5-Watch5","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"]},{"id":1479903630,"appId":"com.fitmetrix.projectwellbeing","title":"Project Wellbeing Connect","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-wellbeing-connect/id1479903630?uo=4","description":"Project Wellbeing clients, download this app to stay connected!

medical services wisely\" (Dr Dominique Thompson, Director, Students' Health Service, University of Bristol).\n\nConcerned about a health problem? Not sure what to do next? Too embarrassed to seek help? The Student Health App (previously known as 'ESC Student') allows you to say goodbye to frustrating, confusing and sometimes dangerous online searches for health information. What's more, the app works offline (apart from the hyperlinks), so you can use the app on-the-go without the need for an internet connection.\n\nHow does the app help? Open the app and easily access over 900 pages packed with reliable health information - anywhere, anytime, and in private:\n\n•\tTroubling health problems – check out what to do next and when to see a pharmacist, nurse or doctor\n•\tEmergencies and general ill health – discover the truth about life-threatening illnesses as well as sleep problems, feeling stressed, and being tired all the time\n•\tCommon ailments – get to the bottom of headaches, find out how to treat your spots, and manage common aches and pains\n•\tMental health – find out what to do when you (or one of your friends) feel low or anxious, self-harm or are worried about drinking too much alcohol\n•\tUseful links – get fast access to hundreds of links to useful further information\n\nWhich topics does the app cover? The Student Health App offers plain-talking reassurance, info and advice on over 125 topics relevant to students in areas such as...\n\n> first aid & emergencies\n> common ailments\n> mental health problems\n> physical (body) symptoms\n> love and sex\n> healthy living\n> travel health\n> alcohol & drugs\n> long-term health problems\n> staying safe at uni\n> accessing health services…\n\n...and more.  \n\nIs it safe? In partnership with the University of Bristol Students' Health Service, the app has been co-created by medical doctors and students and is certified by the NHS England Information Standard as a source of clear, reliable and relevant health information. \n\nCan universities have their own version? We can customise the app for universities - visit www.expertselfcare.com for details. We also review and update the app continuously, at no extra charge. \n\nAre other student-facing apps available? You may want to check out our 'distrACT' app, offering support for young people who self-harm or feel suicidal. Other new student apps are in the pipeline, addressing student wellbeing and the needs of international students. \n\nHow do I find out about new apps?

Shae helps you stay healthy and feeling your best by harnessing the power of your epigenetics to provide real-time precision nutrition and lifestyle advice, on demand.\n \nBecause Shae is scientifically based, you will discover your unique Biotype and Personal Health Code that will help you improve your energy, sleep, stress, weight, pain, digestion, and memory.\n\nUse Shae to know:\nExactly which foods to eat for your particular body\nWhich foods, drinks and sweets may cause you irritation, mood swings, discomfort and pain\nHow often and how much to have your foods and drinks\nWhy each food is good for you to eat or avoid\nFood combining personalized to you\nShopping tips for purchasing the best quality foods\nYour ideal time of day to eat which foods\nWays to cook that are best for your body\nRecipes that incorporate the best foods for you\n \nWhat people say about Shae\n \n“Over the past 12 weeks with Shae my health has had incredible results; plus my body has dropped 4 kgs and 15 cm... I have LOVED discovering what foods work best for me..”\n \n“I've been eating consciously for years. A year ago I started packing on a lot of weight not knowing why. I started using Shae 10 days ago, lost 10lbs and am soaring with energy! I am so grateful..”\n“I am also noticing that using Shae my Psoriasis outbreaks are cooling off, which is great news!!!”\n“I used my shopping list. I did not stop eating out. In a week I feel better..”\n \n“WOW! Just got on the scale and had an unexpected surprise...I am weighing in at 5 pounds less then when I began, less than a week ago...WOOHOOO!!”\n \n“It sures up our identities and give us a lot more integrity about who we are and how we fit into the world and it helps us understand what’s good for us..”\n \n “I am grateful for my 5 pound weight loss along with losing my itchy rash in less than a week! This is amazing!!”\n \nWhat sets Shae apart from the rest\n \nMost diets, programs and apps give you generic information based on population science. What we know now is that one size does not fit all in health. You may have tried many things to look, feel or sleep better and they haven’t worked - that’s because we’re all individuals, all unique. No two people in the world are the same, no two people in the world should have the same diet. No two people will have the same advice from Shae. Shae calculates your unique Personal Health Code, based on YOUR body and tailors your health precisely to you.\n \nPeople who have followed Shae’s insights have started to feel shifts and results in as little as a few days to a few weeks - feeling better, more energy, relief from aches and pains, clearer mental function, happier, more focused and engaged in life, better relationships and enjoying their family more. All of this comes from you feeling your best, feeling fabulous, healthy, happy, vital and alive. When you feel like this everything else works better.\n \nShae is powered by a complex system of evidence based science, algorithms and ratios that calculates your personal health code: the secret to you living a happy and healthy life. Shae then incorporates your code seamlessly into your daily life removing the need for hard work or effort to stay feeling fabulous. Your personal health assistant, taking care of all the hard work for you.\n \nBecause Shae is scientifically based, objective and completely personalized to you, you will need a soft measuring tape to complete the assessment, or you can use the printable version when you register. Do not use online body composition measuring apps as they are not yet advanced enough to give the accuracy that is required for your assessment. Your assessment will take approximately 20-30 minutes and if you fake your answers or skip questions, your results will be inaccurate so please take the time for you.\n \nIf you already have a Shae account, your FREE Shae app will connect with your account and be accessible immediately for all your health needs.","icon":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b6/21/fa/b621faea-eb59-fff7-f543-6d73ba9e8dd9/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Health & Fitness","Food & Drink"],"genreIds":["6013","6023"],"primaryGenre":"Health & Fitness","primaryGenreId":6013,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["EN"],"size":"35204096","requiredOsVersion":"8.0","released":"2016-11-02T18:36:07Z","updated":"2019-10-03T15:16:05Z","releaseNotes":"Thank you for using Shae!

Light \n\nWe attract, not what we want, but who we are! Created as an inspired and guided response for a need for a practical application for the Law of Attraction, this app is a daily empowering practice of expanding and magnifying your level of happiness and attracting a fulfilled life that you desire. Implementing techniques of neurolinguistic programming and theta brain wave studies, each daily affirmation works both with your conscious and subconscious  mind. \n\nEvery one of our thoughts creates a synapse, an electric current in our brain. The established pathways of those currents become our daily paradigms. And, as each electric current, they create a magnetic field around them. This magnetic field is our emotions. And our emotions or, in other words, the magnetic field we send out to the universe, is what attracts our reality back to us. We think – we feel – we create.\npower behind the daily activations is that they are inspired, charged thought patterns that will daily affect your emotions while developing your virtues and improving your reality. As the more virtues we develop, the easier it is for us to manifest through the Law of Attraction and other Universal Laws. \n\nListen to the daily activation or read it out loud and then close your eyes and truly feel a surge of energy through your body making the deep subconscious changes within. You may pick a theme or simply follow a date to begin your path of co-creation with the Creator of All That Is. Weekly applications help you to bring the subconscious work to a practical conscious level, thus truly forming life-changing habits. \n\n“Everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy. This is physics.” – Albert Einstein\nThe question is … how do you match the frequency of the reality you want? This is what iHappy™ Daily is –  inspired, revealed, channeled daily activations of weekly virtues. Enjoy the journey! Be Happy Daily! \niHappy! Are You? :)","icon":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7d/c4/16/7dc41665-82a3-6999-aa76-0d7530b7b3f9/source/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Lifestyle","Health & Fitness"],"genreIds":["6012","6013"],"primaryGenre":"Lifestyle","primaryGenreId":6012,"contentRating":"4+","languages":["EN"],"size":"196298752","requiredOsVersion":"13.0","released":"2019-04-07T05:14:43Z","updated":"2019-10-03T12:32:54Z","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes and improvements.","version":"1.3","price":1.99,"currency":"USD","free":false,"developerId":1457918683,"developer":"YU2SHINE LLC","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/yu2shine-llc/id1457918683?uo=4","developerWebsite":"https://yu2shine.com/ihappy-daily/","score":5,"reviews":18,"currentVersionScore":3,"currentVersionReviews":1,"screenshots":["https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/0d/cf/0d/0dcf0ddd-fa60-5526-8361-eb7d4662e0c3/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/66/db/46/66db462b-c983-6a3d-5081-17dd8e4e063e/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2c/73/c3/2c73c391-a98e-5dcb-900c-3cd596c84c14/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/6c/66/de/6c66defb-f07b-e320-6a44-af161b7fa75b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a1/a8/d5/a1a8d541-9ae9-b2f9-4f10-9f3705c2482b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/3b/b9/d3/3bb9d38b-e2d5-0532-687c-5d3adb9e538e/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/0a/82/85/0a8285e3-5cfe-8fb5-1ede-10527861431f/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c4/fa/74/c4fa7446-d6e0-e8f2-7cd3-be054e1bd5c1/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/d3/62/46/d3624649-b9cb-d8df-503f-922a6ddf924e/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ed/9a/d2/ed9ad2b7-5568-de1d-d464-96e5b205d494/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9f/de/8b/9fde8b55-2393-8f32-cb68-611357011645/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ba/98/85/ba988507-29c6-387d-a764-ab145e0f709d/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/fc/30/12/fc30127a-c877-072b-e171-41f27bbd9738/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9d/73/a5/9d73a5ed-8a8a-b878-913a-b2ca673afebf/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"]},{"id":1434669561,"appId":"com.infotel.wellbeing","title":"Infotel Wellbeing","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infotel-wellbeing/id1434669561?uo=4","description":"Wellbeing est l'application baromètre du bien-être par Infotel.
